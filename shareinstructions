Instructions for copying “Filename” to desired “directory”:
1. Enter into directory with desired code you want to copy
2. Type “cp Filename directory”
3. Open code and in bottom buffer space say “yes to revert”


Don’t have to do this but just use “sudo” run or tunnel set up for root privileges

To do a bunch of lines/commmands in a terminal:

1) Create a new file “FILE” with:

#!/bin/bash

sudo ip tun tap add dev tun1 mode tun
etc..

2) “sudo mv FILE.txt FILE” to change name from FILE.txt to FILE

3) In VM do “chmod 700 FILE” to create executable

4) Open FILE in VM and get rid of formatting changes between systems

5) “sudo ./FILE”
